File BaRJ (File Backup and Restore Java) is a multi-platform backup utility for files. It is intended to be a highly configurable tool
that can create secure backups of preconfigured files and folders and can be easily scheduled.

> [!WARNING]
> File BaRJ is a free tool that is provided "as is", **without warranty of any kind**. It might be the perfect tool you need, or leave you
with gigabytes of encrypted hot mess instead of your precious data. By using it, you accept the risk of data loss (among others).

## Features

### Already supported

File BaRJ comes with the following features

- Full backups of folders or files
- Incremental backups of folders or files
- Optional encryption using
  - an RSA key pair
  - a password
  - AES-256 keys for each file and the archive contents
- Change detection based on:
  - file size,
  - last modification time,
  - configurable hash algorithms
- Compression of the backup archive
- Backup archive splitting to configurable chunks
- Backup archive integrity checks
- Restore/unpack previous backup
  - Using latest increment
  - Using a selected earlier increment
  - Restoring all files from the backup
  - Restoring only some included files (partial restore)
- Inspect available backup increments
- Inspect content of a backup increment
- Duplicate handling (storing duplicates of the same file only once)
- Deletes left-over files from the restore directory (if they had been in scope for the backup)
- Merge previous backup increments

### Planned features

- Delete selected backup increments
- UI for convenient configuration

## Modules

- [File BaRJ Stream IO](file-barj-stream-io/README.md)
- [File BaRJ Core](file-barj-core/README.md)
- [File BaRJ Job](file-barj-job/README.md)

# Limitations

- The file permissions are only captured from the point of view of the current user on Windows or other non-POSIX compliant systems.
- Cross platform restore can run into file name case issues when restoring a backup using case-sensitive paths on a system where paths are case-insensitive.
